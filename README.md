# Analyzing the priciest rental markets in the US (Q3, 2022)

## Visualizing the most expensive home rental markets in Tableau, from data supplied by Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI), data found at https://www.zillow.com/research/data/.

### I pulled some home rental data at the end of September 2022 from Zillow into Tableau. Typical home rental rates (weighted with the ZORI formula) encountered in the most expensive metro areas. Glenwood Springs tops the list at $9,000+ a month, certainly skewed by Aspen, no doubt. But still! Not shockingly, 5 of the top 7 markets are close to ski resorts and mountain activities. And in general, no surprise, if you're near the ocean or near ski resorts, you're going to pay a lot more to live there.
